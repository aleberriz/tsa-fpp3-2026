# 1. THE ALGORITHM, IN FOUR STEPS
#
# Additive scheme, y_t = T_t + S_t + R_t:
#
#   1. Trend      T_t by centered moving average
#                   m even -> 2xm-MA
#                   m odd  -> m-MA
#   2. Detrend    D_t = y_t - T_t
#   3. Season     average D_t within each position of the
#                 season, then shift so the m values sum to 0,
#                 then repeat that shape along the series
#   4. Remainder  R_t = D_t - S_t = y_t - T_t - S_t
#
# Multiplicative scheme, y_t = T_t * S_t * R_t: the same four
# steps with divisions in place of subtractions, and the m
# seasonal values scaled to average 1 rather than shifted to
# sum to 0.
#
# Check each step against classical_decomposition() before you
# build the next one on top of it.

# ============================================================
# 2. WHAT MAKES A DECOMPOSITION GOOD
#
# Two criteria, both about the remainder:
#
#   1. Its variance should be SMALLER than the variance of the
#      trend and the seasonal components. The trend and the
#      season should be doing most of the explaining.
#   2. It should carry AS LITTLE AUTOCORRELATION AS POSSIBLE.
#      Structure left in the remainder is structure the model
#      failed to capture.
#
# Criterion 2 is Session 4's correlogram, pointed at what the
# model missed. That is also what Session 9 does with residuals.
#
# Sometimes no decomposition satisfies both across the whole
# series. Take the closest one, and say where it falls short.
# ============================================================

# Criterion 1, as numbers.

  summarise(
    var_trend     = var(trend_manual, na.rm = TRUE),

# Criterion 2, as a picture.

  autoplot() +
  labs(title = "Correlogram of the remainder")


# ============================================================
# 3. THE LIMITATIONS OF CLASSICAL DECOMPOSITION
#
#   - No trend estimate for the first and last few points, which
#     is Session 6's ends problem.
#   - The seasonal component is forced to repeat unchanged from
#     year to year, so it cannot follow a season that evolves.
#   - It is not robust to outliers. An unusual value in the
#     middle of the series contaminates the trend, then the
#     detrended series, then the seasonal component.
#
# The third one is worth seeing rather than being told, which is
# what exercise 1 is for.
# ============================================================


# ============================================================
# 4. STL
#
# "Seasonal and Trend decomposition using LOESS". LOESS is local
# regression: to fit a value at a point, take its nearest
# neighbours, weight them by how close they are, and fit a low
# degree polynomial to that neighbourhood. Do that at every
# point and you get a smooth curve with no global formula.
#
# STL applies LOESS repeatedly to separate the components.
#
# WHAT IT BUYS YOU
#   - the seasonal component is allowed to change over time, and
#     you control how fast
#   - any seasonal period, not just monthly or quarterly
#   - multiple seasonal periods at once
#   - you control the smoothness of the trend
#   - it can be made robust to outliers
#
# WHAT IT COSTS
#   - additive only. For a multiplicative series, take logs
#     first, which is Session 5's identity.
#   - no automatic handling of calendar effects
#   - the windows usually need tuning by hand
#
# THE TWO WINDOWS
#   trend(window = )   how fast the trend may change.
#                      Smaller = more flexible. Must be ODD.
#                      Default 21.
#   season(window = )  how fast the season may change.
#                      Smaller = more flexible. Must be ODD.
#                      Default 13.
#                      "periodic" makes it infinite, which
#                      forces a constant season, like classical
#                      decomposition.

# does not always improve things, so try it both ways.

# ============================================================
# EXERCISES
#
# From here the script sets each exercise up and stops.
# ============================================================

# ---- exercise 1 (07_D): gas, and an outlier ----
# The last five years of quarterly Gas production.
gas <- tail(aus_production, 5 * 4) |> select(Gas)
gas

# YOUR TURN:
#   a. classical_decomposition() with type = "multiplicative".
#      Extract the components.
#   b. Compute and plot the seasonally adjusted series over the
#      original.
#   c. Add 300 to ONE observation near the MIDDLE of the series,
#      recompute, and plot the seasonally adjusted series. What
#      happened, and to which components?
#   d. Now move the outlier near the END of the series and do it
#      again. One sentence on why the answer is different.
#
# Before you run (d), predict the answer from Session 6: which
# region of the series can the 2x4-MA reach, and which can it
# not?

# ---- exercise 2 (07_E): STL Example 3, the labour series ----
# Monthly Australian civilian labour force, Feb 1978 to Aug 1995.
# Needs the fma package.
#
# Loading fma prints "The following object is masked _by_
# '.GlobalEnv': gas". That is expected and harmless: fma also
# ships a dataset called gas, and your own `gas` from exercise 1
# wins. Session 4's lag() masking was the same mechanism.
library(fma)
labour_tsibble <- as_tsibble(labour)
labour_tsibble |> autoplot(value)

# YOUR TURN:
#   1.1 STL with the default windows. Plot the components.
#   1.2 Look at the 1991-1992 crisis and answer:
#       - do the trend and seasonal components capture it?
#       - compare the grey scale bars across panels. Is this a
#         good decomposition, by the two criteria in section 2?
#       - tune the windows to capture the crisis better. Report
#         what you tried, not only what worked.

# ---- exercise 3 (07_E): STL on daily electricity demand ----

dcmp_1 |> autoplot()

dcmp_1 |> ACF(remainder) |> autoplot()

# YOUR TURN:
#   2.1 What is wrong with this decomposition? Use both criteria
#       from section 2: the relative variances, read off the
#       grey bars, and the remainder's ACF.
#   2.2 Tune both windows to improve it as far as you can. Plot
#       the components and the remainder's ACF again, and say
#       what improved and what did not.
#
# You will not reach white noise on this series. Say so, and say
# which criterion you traded away.
