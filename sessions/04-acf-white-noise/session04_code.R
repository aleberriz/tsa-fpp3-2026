# Two warnings are expected here and neither is a bug:
#   * aes_string() was deprecated in ggplot2 3.0.0. It is kept
#     because it injects a column name held in a variable; the
#     modern idiom is aes(x = Quarter, y = .data[[lag_name]]).
#   * "Removed 4 rows containing missing values" -- those are the
#     four NAs at the top of Beer_lag4.

# six years. The same number would mean two years of monthly
# data, or under half a year of weekly data.
