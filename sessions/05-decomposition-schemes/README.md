# Session 05 — Additive vs multiplicative; detrended and seasonally adjusted series

**fpp3:** 3.2, 3.4

**Focus:** The additive and multiplicative schemes; how square-root / cube-root / log / inverse
transformations differ in strength and what that tells you about the scheme; automating the
additive-vs-multiplicative decision; detrended and seasonally adjusted series, computed by hand and
checked with `all.equal()`; mixed schemes.

**Homework:** Reproduce the notebook's Example 1 and Example 2 manual computations and verify them
with `all.equal()`.

**Outcome:** Student picks the right scheme for a series and can produce detrended and seasonally
adjusted versions.

> Box–Cox (fpp3 3.1) is not covered here. It comes in Session 11, next to forecasting with
> transformations in Session 12, because the two belong together.
