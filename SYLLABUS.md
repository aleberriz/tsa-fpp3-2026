## Subject description

The analysis of data that have been observed at different points in time leads to new and unique
problems in statistical modeling and inference. The obvious correlation introduced by the sampling of
adjacent points in time can severely restrict the applicability of the many conventional statistical
methods, traditionally dependent upon the assumption that these adjacent observations are independent
and identically distributed (Shumway and Stoffer, 2017). Specific methods and techniques are therefore
necessary to handle time series data.

This course covers the analysis of time series and the foundations of forecasting. Students learn to
explore and visualize a series, decompose it into its components, interpret autocorrelation, transform
a series when its variance is not stable, and then build, evaluate and compare forecasting models. Two
families of models are studied: the benchmark methods, which set the standard any serious model must
beat, and the exponential smoothing family, taught end to end — from the simple exponential smoothing
recursion through Holt–Winters to the full ETS taxonomy, with maximum-likelihood estimation, automatic
model selection, and forecasting from a fitted ETS model.

A defining feature of the course is that the central methods are built by hand before they are used
through a library. Students implement classical decomposition, simple exponential smoothing,
prediction intervals and error metrics themselves, and then verify their results against the R
implementation. The objective is that students understand what the software does, rather than only how
to call it.

Time series analysis and forecasting are intrinsic to econometrics, finance, business, supply chain
management, climate and weather forecasting, predictive maintenance and many more disciplines.
Examples of time series data include the continuous monitoring of a person's heart rate, hourly
readings of air temperature, daily closing price of a company stock, monthly rainfall data, yearly
sales figures.

ARIMA models, time series regression and dynamic regression are **not** covered in this course. They
belong to the follow-up course, *Forecasting for Time Series*, for which this course is the
prerequisite. This course stops at the end of the exponential smoothing family. By that point students
hold one complete model family, along with every prerequisite the follow-up course builds on.

## Learning objectives

The main purpose of this course is to provide students with the necessary mathematical background and
tools to effectively handle time series analyses, as well as with a standardized workflow to
systematically tackle time series data. By the end of the course students should be able to:

- Explain what autocorrelation means and why it matters in Time Series Analysis (TSA), and why a time
  series cannot be treated as a sample of independent and identically distributed observations.
- Apply the graphical techniques specific to TSA and interpret what they show.
- Identify and capture the components of a time series by several different methods, and explain the
  technical details behind each method and the caveats that come with it.
- Select and justify a variance-stabilizing transformation, and handle forecasts and prediction
  intervals correctly when a transformation is in place.
- Produce forecasts from the benchmark methods and from a decomposition, then judge them honestly
  using train/test splits, point accuracy metrics and time series cross-validation.
- Fit any member of the exponential smoothing family, tailor it to the series at hand, produce point
  forecasts and prediction intervals from it, and explain the estimation and model-selection criteria
  that chose it.
- Implement the core methods from first principles and verify them against a library implementation.

## Teaching methodology

**Prior to every session, students must read any materials provided by the professor.** Reading the
materials in advance will allow you to get the most out of each lecture. During this reading, look at
the examples but do not try to solve them. Every session in the program below names the textbook
sections to read beforehand.

Homework is provided after each class and is due before the next session. Detailed solutions are
published after each due date. Homework must show effort but need not be perfect; it is not
individually corrected. The two group assignments do receive detailed written feedback.

Optional online preparation tutorials are offered before the midterm and before the final exam.

| Learning Activity | Weighting | Estimated hours |
|---|---|---|
| Lectures | 40 % | 30 |
| Discussions | 6,7 % | 5 |
| Exercises in class, Asynchronous sessions, Field Work | 13,3 % | 10 |
| Group work | 13,3 % | 10 |
| Individual studying | 26,7 % | 20 |
| **TOTAL** | **100 %** | **75 / 75** |

## AI policy

**Restricted use of Generative AI**

Generative AI tools can produce code, forecasts, and written interpretations for many of the tasks in
this course. However, the objective here is not just to obtain an answer, but to understand the
underlying time series techniques and learn how to implement them manually. For that reason,
AI-generated code or results are not allowed. You may use course materials, documentation, and your
own reasoning, but the analysis, implementation, and interpretation must be your own.

Therefore, the use of GenAI is not permitted unless otherwise stated by the instructor. If a student
is found to have used AI-generated content for any form of assessment, it will be considered academic
misconduct and the student might fail the respective assignment or the course.

## Evaluation

| Criteria | Weight |
|---|---|
| Intermediate tests (midterm, Session 10) | 30 % |
| Final Exam (Session 20) | 30 % |
| Group Work | 20 % |
| Individual work | 10 % |
| Class Participation | 10 % |
| **TOTAL** | **100 %** |

**Group Work** consists of two group assignments: implementing classical decomposition from scratch,
released in Session 7, and the Efficient Market Hypothesis, released in Session 17. Both receive
detailed written feedback. See [`assignments/`](assignments/).

**Individual work** is the per-session homework, assigned after each class and due before the next.
Detailed solutions are published after each due date.

**Class Participation** is assessed on attendance and on engagement during in-class exercises and
discussions.

**Intermediate tests** is the midterm exam, held in Session 10. Both exams are 20 multiple-choice
questions with four options each.

Homework and assignments are submitted on **Blackboard**, not in this repository.

### Midterm retake policy

The date for the midterm is the date of session 10, as specified in this syllabus.

There is no retake for the midterm. If any student cannot attend the midterm for personal / work
reasons the final exam will have a weight of 60% instead of 30%. That is, it will encompass both the
midterm and the final exam weights.

### Re-sit / re-take policy

Students with less than 3.5 out of 10 in the final exam will have to go to the retake exam, regardless
of their performance on the other gradable items of the course.

Retakers need to join a group to do the assignments or do the assignments on their own, but they do
need to do the assignments.

Retakers do not need to deliver any homework, they will be evaluated solely based on the group
assignments and the exams.

Retakers are subject to the same midterm and final exam requirements than the rest of the students.
They also need to comply with the requirement for a grade of at least 3.5 in the final to be able to
pass the subject (otherwise the rest of their work will not be considered).

The final grade for retakers will be computed as:

- 30 % Midterm exam
- 30 % Final exam
- 40 % Group assignments (it is therefore very important that retakers find a good group for the
  assignments)
